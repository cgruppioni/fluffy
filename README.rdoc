Fluffy: Capstone project for Metis/Thoughtbot Summer 2014

Fluffy combines game mechanics with social good, by turning the standard "taking care of a cartoon animal app" (think: Talking TomCat or Tamagotchi) and connecting you with real local animal shelters.

The gems I used in the product include:
- Monban - User authentication
- Geocoder - Searching by location
- Carrierwave - Uploading images, and resizing them into different types (ex: avatar, profile picture, etc.)
- Stripe - Caregivers can buy credits which they need for some interactions
